  The Sentinel, founded in 1800, was Trenton’s first – and one of the state’s earliest – Black newspapers. It later merged into the Trenton Herald.  
  The Sentinel was a pioneering voice in the post-Reconstruction era. Founder R. Henri Herbert also served as editor. The paper served the growing Black population of Trenton and surrounding areas, while offering a mix of local news, political advocacy, education updates, church notices, and social commentary.  
  The Sentinel was founded during a period when Black communities across the Northeast were working to build their own political, cultural, and informational institutions in the face of segregation and exclusion from mainstream media. As one of the earliest known African American newspapers in New Jersey, The Sentinel responded to a critical need: a public forum where Black residents could speak in their own voices, document their own lives, and articulate their own vision for civic belonging. At a time when national Reconstruction gains were rapidly being rolled back, the existence of a Black-run newspaper in Trenton was itself an act of resistance and community building.  
  The paper was founded and edited by R. Henri Herbert, a respected Black educator, civic leader, and member of a well-established Trenton family known for its commitment to public service. Herbert and his relatives, including his sister Priscilla Herbert, belonged to a generation of Black intellectuals who believed deeply in racial uplift, community advocacy, and the power of literacy. Through The Sentinel, Herbert created a platform that combined political analysis, community news, and everyday storytelling that centered the lives of Black Trentonians at a moment when white newspapers either ignored or distorted those experiences.  
    
  The Sentinel was published “every Saturday afternoon” at 4 North Broad Street and quickly became a touchstone for the city’s Black residents. Issues sold for .3 cents a piece, or $1.25 for an annual subscription. The pages were filled with advertisements for local shows, various products, and services. And on just about every page, the publishers touted their ad guarantee in the left-hand column:   
  *“The Sentinel has a larger weekly circulation than any weekly paper published in this city (with one exception.) This statement we are prepared to verify at any time. Advertisers will do well to remember this fact, as our advertising rates are lower than those of any other newspaper with equal circulation.”*  
  Its editorial stance was often described as “staunchly Republican,” reflecting the political realities of the time, when many Black voters aligned with the party of Lincoln as a defense against the rising tide of white supremacist violence and disenfranchisement. Herbert used the paper to encourage civic participation, reinforce the importance of voting rights, and highlight the issues shaping Black life in the post-Reconstruction era.  
  The Sentinel also featured local reporting, opinion essays, social notes, and a popular “Chit-Chat” column filled with community gossip, announcements, and personal updates, an early form of the hyperlocal journalism that would later become a fixture of Black newspapers nationwide. These sections offered readers a sense of connection and belonging, affirming the ordinary joys and struggles of Black life in a segregated city. They also created an archival record of Black social worlds that would otherwise have gone undocumented.  
  Operating a Black newspaper in the 1880s came with steep challenges. The economic base for such publications was often fragile, and accessing the printing, distribution, and advertising infrastructure controlled by white business networks required constant negotiation. Despite these obstacles, Herbert maintained The Sentinel for several years, demonstrating both personal commitment and community support. Its existence stands as a testament to the determination of Black publishers who refused to let their communities go voiceless.  
  By 1883, The Sentinel merged with the Trenton Herald, a move that likely reflected both financial pressures and strategic considerations. Such mergers were common among early Black newspapers, which often faced limited capital, competition from larger outlets, and inconsistent access to resources. While the merger meant the end of The Sentinel as an independent publication, it also suggests that Herbert sought to preserve some of the paper’s influence and readership through consolidation.  
  Even with its short publication run, The Sentinel occupies an important place in the history of Black media in New Jersey. It predates many of the state’s more documented 20th-century Black newspapers, offering an early example of how African American communities created their own information systems long before the modern civil rights movement. Surviving snippets, such as the “Chit-Chat” column, reveal a lively, self-determined press that prioritized representation, community cohesion, and political empowerment.

As a trusted source of local news, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards. All editorial decisions are made in the interest of our readers.  
* **Historical notes & impact:**   
  The Trenton Journal emerged as a response to deep information inequities in New Jersey’s capital city. Founded by community media entrepreneur Kenneth Miles, the publication grew from a simple observation: Trenton residents needed stories that reflected their lived experience, their neighborhoods, and their struggles. Those stories were rarely being told.   
  Miles began with listening sessions supported by civic media groups like the Listening Post Collective. During these sessions he gathered insights from residents who long felt ignored or misrepresented by traditional media. These insights guided Miles in developing a platform designed to reflect and serve the people of Trenton rather than to extract stories from them.  
  From the beginning, the Trenton Journal positioned itself as a Black-owned multimedia outlet dedicated to bridging information gaps in a majority Black and Latino city. Instead of relying on crime-heavy or deficit-focused narratives—common pitfalls in mainstream coverage of communities of color—the Journal centered community knowledge, local culture, and positive storytelling. The publication has focused on heritage preservation, grassroots organizing, neighborhood events, education, and health justice. This approach reflected a deeper belief: that local news is not just about relaying information but also reinforcing community power and dignity.  
    
  As the publication developed, The Trenton Journal transitioned from a weekly newsletter to a news website. Along the way, it benefitted from a growing network of support for hyperlocal and community-driven news in New Jersey. The shrinking of legacy media, including cuts at regional dailies and the disappearances of major outlets, created both a void and an opportunity. The Trenton Journal stepped into that vacuum with a digital-first strategy, publishing articles, multimedia features, and photo-driven storytelling that felt accessible and rooted in local experience.  
  One of the most notable aspects of the Journal’s coverage is its commitment to preserving and uplifting Black history and heritage in Trenton. Stories about African American Revolutionary War soldiers, local historians, and the development of Trenton’s first African American museum illustrate the publication’s role in shaping public memory. In a city with a rich Black cultural legacy, this work contributes to a broader, intersectional effort to reclaim historical narratives that have been marginalized or erased. Such storytelling doesn’t just fill information gaps—it actively pushes against generational silences created by racism and urban neglect.  
  The Journal’s focus on civic engagement is equally significant. By publishing straightforward explanations of local government decisions, community events, school issues, and neighborhood resources, the outlet helps equip Trenton residents with information that directly shapes daily life. This is especially critical in communities historically excluded from mainstream reporting or political power. In this way, the Trenton Journal functions not just as a media outlet but as a civic infrastructure tool that supports informed participation, community mobilization, and mutual care.  
  As part of New Jersey’s expanding ecosystem of Black-owned media, the Trenton Journal contributes to a broader movement to strengthen information access and narrative power for communities of color. Outlets like this push against structural inequities in the media landscape by offering alternative models grounded in equity, community care, and autonomy.

  The *New Jersey Trumpet* served as a weekly voice for Black communities in Jersey City and, later, Newark from 1887 to 1897\. Published by William Murrell, the paper likely aimed to advocate for civil rights, economic advancement, and political participation during a time of rapid urban growth and entrenched discrimination.  
  Like many 19th-century minority-owned newspapers, it likely faced persistent financial pressures—limited advertising from mainstream businesses, a small but devoted subscriber base, and the high cost of printing. These challenges, combined with competition from larger regional papers, likely contributed to its closure around 1897\.

Calling itself the “Voice of the Colored People,” it aimed to represent and empower Newark’s Black community during the Great Depression and early World War II. 

The paper highlighted local news, civic issues, and achievements within African-American life, offering a platform for voices excluded from mainstream media. Serving Newark and Essex County’s growing Black population, it fostered community pride and awareness. Economic hardship, limited advertising revenue, and wartime pressures likely led to its closure.

Ark Republic serves African-American and diasporic communities in Newark and beyond, and has produced impactful projects such as the *Being Beloved* podcast, centering narratives of formerly incarcerated women. Despite its innovation, the outlet faces challenges common to small independent media, relying on a hybrid revenue model of memberships, grants, and sponsorships to sustain its community-focused journalism.

* **Historical notes & impact:**

	New Jersey Urban News was founded in 2018 and bills itself as “your Black news source in the Garden State.” Its mission is to cover New Jersey’s African American communities – focusing on stories, issues, and perspectives that are often overlooked by mainstream media. The publication serves as a platform for civic reporting, culture, business, health, education, and community life across New Jersey’s Black population. 

	Since its founding, New Jersey Urban News has contributed to diversifying New Jersey’s media landscape — offering coverage and visibility to stories of Black lives, achievements, challenges, and local civic issues that may otherwise go under-reported. In 2024, it received a grant from the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium (NJCIC) to expand reporting capacity by funding a full-time editor and reporter.

As a digital-only outlet operating in the modern media environment, New Jersey Urban News likely faces the same structural challenges as other independent local news organizations: generating sufficient revenue to fund quality journalism, competing for attention against larger media, and serving a broad—but niche—audience.

* **Mission statement or editorial philosophy**: “The Voice of New Ark’s Inner City.”  
* **Historical notes & impact:** 

*Black Newark*, later published under the related titles *Black News* and *Black New Ark*, emerged in 1968 during a period of intense political organizing and community rebuilding in Newark following the 1967 uprising. Published by the Community for Unified Newark and identifying itself as “The Voice of New Ark’s Inner City,” the paper served Newark’s Black communities by reporting on local politics, grassroots activism, cultural development, and broader struggles for Black self-determination. Its editors—Abu Ansar, Yusef Iman, Daoud Abdullah, and Simba Risasi—were associated with activist and nationalist circles, reflecting the majority-Black neighborhoods and offered reporting that mainstream newspapers often ignored.

Like many small movement-based newspapers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, *Black Newark* likely faced chronic financial challenges, relying on donations, volunteer labor, and limited advertising tied to sympathetic local businesses or community organizations rather than the publication’s alignment with protest movements and community empowerment efforts. Through its coverage and commentary, the paper helped shape political consciousness in Newark’s commercial revenue model. Its publication gaps, title changes, and eventual transition into *Black News* suggest ongoing organizational and financial strain, as well as shifts in Newark’s activist landscape during this period. Rising printing costs, competition for limited funding among grassroots groups, and the evolving political climate of the early 1970s likely contributed to its eventual discontinuation.

* **Primary focus/content:**  Labor, trade unions, United Black workers  
* **Mission statement or editorial philosophy**: Its stated purpose was "to help educate, expose, inform, and even agitate our fellow workers out of a feeling of complacency and frustration. Its further purpose is to assist in dealing realistically with the many problems facing workers on the job, in the community and around the world.”  
* **Historical notes & impact:** 

	The *Black Voice,* published in Newark in 1970 by United Black Workers, served African American industrial workers–especially those employed at the Ford Mahwah Assembly Plant–during a period of growing labor activism and racial discrimination within New Jersey’s manufacturing sector. Its stated mission was to “help educate, expose, inform, and even agitate our fellow workers out of a feeling of complacency and frustration,” emphasizing practical information and political awareness for workers facing inequities on the job and in their communities. As a worker-produced periodical, it likely combined reporting, commentary, and organizing updates intended to support collective action and to articulate the concerns of Black laborers who were often exldued from union leadership and decision-making spaces.

	The publication’s impact lay in its role as an internal communication and mobilization tool for Black workers seeking fair treatment, workplace rights, and a voice within both local industry and broader labor struggles. Like man grassroots labor periodicals, *Black Voice* likely faced challenges related to funding, time and organizational capacity–given that contributors were likely full-time workers–and may have struggled to sustain operations amid workplace pressure or shifting labor conditions. Its revenue model appears to have relied on low-cost, self-published distribution supported by United Black Workers rather than commercial advertising, which limited long-term sustainability.

	*Unity and Struggle* was a political periodical published in Newark in the early 1970s by the Committee for Unified Newark, an organization that later became the Congress of African Peoples and subsequently the Revolutionary Communist League (Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse-tung Thought). Serving a primarily African American readership, the publication addressed issues of community self-determination, Black political education, anti-racist organizing, and socialist theory. Its content often reflected the ideological evolution of CFUN—from Newark-based Black nationalist organizing toward broader Marxist-Leninist frameworks—making the paper an important record of how local movements in New Jersey engaged with national debates around liberation, socialism, and grassroots political power. Through essays, organizational updates, and analysis of local and global events, *Unity and Struggle* functioned as a tool for political education and coordination among activists in Newark and beyond.

Like many movement publications of the era, *Unity and Struggle* likely faced challenges tied to limited financial resources, volunteer-driven production, and the instability of small political organizations undergoing ideological transformation. Its funding model appears to have relied primarily on organizational resources, donations, and low-cost distribution, and some commercial advertising. The periodical remains an important record of Black political organizing in Newark and the intellectual development of key nationalist and socialist movements of the 1970s.

	The *Black Women’s Unitied Front Newsletter* emerged in Newark in the mid-1970s as a grassroots communication organ for Black women engaged in political education, anti-oppression organizing, and community self-determination. Produced by the Black Women’s United Front– a formation connected to Black feminist, socialist and prison-abolition movements of the era– the newsletter served local working-class Black women, students, incarcerated women, and families navigating state violence and economic inequality. Its issues likely featured political education articles, reports from community campaigns, and analyses of schooling and childcare inequities, critiques of gendered labor exploitation, and book reviews aimed at building a shared ideological foundation. In a period when Blak women’s leadership was often sidelined within both mainstream feminism and male-dominated Black liberation organizations, the newsletter functioned as a vital platform affirming Black women’s intellectual and political agency.

	Operating with minimal resources, the publication likely relied on volunteer labor, community donations, and low-cost distribution–typical of movement periodicals of the 1970s. The work of gathering contributions, printing, and circulating issues often took place in homes, community centers, or borrowed offices, reflecting both the constraints and the ingenuity of small, women-led organizations. Challenges such as limited funding, shifting political landscapes, and heightened policing of radical groups likely contriubted to the newsletter’s eventual discontinuation.
